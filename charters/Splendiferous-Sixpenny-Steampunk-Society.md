#The Splendiferous Sixpenny Steampunk Society
*Last modified 2016-09-02*

##Purpose: 
The purpose of this fine Society shall be the exploration of, enjoyment of, and education about all things Steampunk. Our semi-fortnightly meetings will be occupied by sharing, discussing, and creating Steampunk media. 

##Membership: 
Any one with an interest in Steampunk of any form may consider themselves a member. Experience aboard airships not required.

##Officers and Roles: 
The Society is headed by an Airship Captain, who may appoint crew at will. The Captain’s responsibilities include co-ordinating meetings, sending informational electronic telegrams, ensuring the airship and meetings are sufficiently provisioned, maintaining an Airship’s Log-Book accessible to all members, and fending off any Kraken attacks. Should there be any crew, they may relieve the Captain of whatsoever duties are agreed upon and entered in the Log-Book. Crew may not be acquired by press-gang. The Captain and crew may amend and append any appropriate elements to their titles at will.

##Transition Protocol: 
Should the Airship Captain need to relinquish command for any reason, including but not limited to graduation, overwork, wanderlust, and Kraken-related injury, resignation shall be their honorable recourse. Prior to stepping down, the Captain must appoint a successor and provide notice to the Society’s members. Should a crewmember vacate a role, the Captain under which a successor would serve may determine the ifs and means of replacement. 

##Club Materials, Purchases, and Space: 
The Captain is responsible for the Society’s and Airship’s stores. Members will share costume items, literary and artistic materials, and crafting and decorative components which are donated to or purchased on behalf of the Society. A list of community materials shall be kept in the Log-Book.

##Events and Activities: 
At each regularly-scheduled meeting, a topic of interest shall be presented and discussed, in order that the club might further its purpose of exploration, enjoyment, and education. Meeting times may also be spend on crafting, costuming, colloquy, roleplay, or any other Steampunk-flavored pursuit. In addition to or in place of the semi-fortnightly meetings, the Society will also attend local Steampunk gatherings. Dandy finery is encouraged but not required at any and all Society meetings.

##Amendment Procedures:
The current copy of this charter must be kept available to all of the Society’s members, in the Log-Book. The Captain may amend it at will, provided the members are notified.
